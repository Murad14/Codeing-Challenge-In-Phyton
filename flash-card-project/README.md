# Flash Card App

### Flashcards are small note cards used for testing and improving memory through practiced information retrieval. Flashcards are typically two-sided, with the prompt on one side and the information about the prompt on the other. This may include names, vocabulary, concepts, or procedures.

### In this flash card, each vocabulary will stand for max 3 sec for guessing. After that answer will be displayed on another card. If the user guesses the correct (✔️) vocabulary then that ✔️ vocabulary will not appear for next attempt.
